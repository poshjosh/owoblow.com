### Why you need Online Auctions ###

__Great deals, reasonable prices__

- The seller gets compensation for something he might have otherwise discarded.

- the buyer receives something he wants for the price that he’s agreed upon.

- The item is assigned to the buyer who objectively wants it the most, and
therefore we can assume this is the optimal/best use of the item.

__Convenience__

- Location - The primary benefit of online auctions is convenience. As a seller you can reach
buyers from any location. As a bidder, you can make offers no matter your location.

- Time - The auction is also open 24/7. You also save time by not having to
move around marketing, selling or buying items.

__Open__

- Instant Feedback - You know instantly if you have won the bid, how many people
are bidding against you etc

__Freedom__

- Choices - Online auctions offer more choices.

- Level playing field - Sometimes, bidders and would-be buyers cow away from purchasing a particular product because of a suspicion that the value indicated isn’t an accurate picture of the product. However, online auctions eliminate this, giving every participant the confidence that the commodity’s value is right. This confidence is further boosted when more bidders express interest in it.

### Why does Government need Online Auction ###

In the developed countries, online bidding for electronic procurement has been
widely used and forms a mature business model. Mature because it has been
successfully implemented in a variety of government organizations and enterprises.
In China, for example, the Federal Department of General Affairs purchases up to
$10 billion worth of materials each year through online bidding. Likewise, in
Singapore, the government through the Government Electronic Commerce Center (GECC)
purchases products worth $1.1 billion. The Singaporean Government also plans to
transfer 80 percent of procurement to the GECC.

> China implemented a 'bidding act', and has been vigorously promoting the
> bidding system. Due to the advantages of online bidding over the traditional
> procurement process, the Chinese government has absorbed the online bidding
> procurement into the e-government system, and each year, government departments
> use online bidding for public procurement.
